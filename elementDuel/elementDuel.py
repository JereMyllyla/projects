# The program is a more complex version of the rock-paper-scissors game. The game involves five elements, each with 2 strengths and 2 weaknesses.
## The computer randomly selects one element, after which the player also chooses one element.
## The program compares the choices and determines the round result (win/loss/draw), then calculates the life points for the players.
## The game continues until one of the players wins 5 rounds.
