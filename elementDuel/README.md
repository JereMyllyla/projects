# Element Duel
A more complex version of the rock-paper-scissors game.
The game involves five elements, each with two strengths and two weaknesses!

## Elements:

- **Lightning:** Wins against Water and Wind - loses to Earth and Fire.
- **Wind:** Wins against Water and Earth - loses to Lightning and Fire.
- **Water:** Wins against Earth and Fire - loses to Lightning and Wind.
- **Earth:** Wins against Lightning and Fire - loses to Wind and Water.
- **Fire:** Wins against Lightning and Wind - loses to Water and Earth.  

## Gameplay:
The computer randomly selects one element, after which the player also chooses one element.
The program compares the choices and determines the round result (win, loss, or draw) and calculates the well-being points for the players.
The game continues until one of the players wins 5 rounds.

## Add-ons:
The program doesn't use any add-ons; a standard Python installation is sufficient.
